# SNIPERFI Project Chat Log

## Initial Code Review and Improvements

We started with a code review of the SNIPERFI project, identifying several areas for improvement:

- Project structure organization
- Error handling implementation
- Security enhancements
- Performance optimization
- Code consistency

## Key Implementations

### Dashboard Functionality
- Implemented proper loading states with visual indicators
- Added efficient data caching to reduce API calls
- Created comprehensive error handling
- Implemented secure private key management with toggle visibility

### Wallet Generator
The wallet generator was reviewed, which handles creating Solana keypairs:

```python
from solana.keypair import Keypair
import json
import sys

def generate_wallets(count):
    wallets = []
    for _ in range(count):
        wallet = Keypair()
        wallets.append({
            'public_key': str(wallet.public_key),
            'private_key': list(wallet.secret_key)
        })
    
    with open('wallets.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(wallets, f, indent=4)
    
    return {'success': True, 'count': count}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count = int(sys.argv[1])
    result = generate_wallets(count)
    print(json.dumps(result))
